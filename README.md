# SISU - STUDY PLANNING APPLICATION

## Overview
##### SISU is a study planning application that allows students to create and manage their personalized study plans. It provides an intuitive interface for adding, editing, and organizing courses, helping users keep track of their academic progress and plan for upcoming semesters effectively.
##### The project was part of the university course Programming 3, and it was done in Spring 2023 in a 3 persons project. Even though I created this project during my first study year (note. Prog 3 course is a course for 2nd year students), it is the only relatively big project I can show and I think it demonstrates basic object oriented coding skills and basic group project skills. 

## How to run?
1. Clone the project 
2. You need to install JDK and Maven.
 

Working directoryn polku on oltava Sisu-projekti\Sisu
Ohjelma käynnistyy ajamalla Sisu\src\main\java\fi.tuni.prog3.sisu\Sisu tiedoston.
Intellij IDEA:lla pitää edit configuration. Pitää kanssa ladata maven asioita
